Using the movie database(TMDb) API, feed upcoming movies and show details from movies.

I started structuring the project with [Clean Archicture] (https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)

### Enviroment

- Xcode 10
- Swift 4.2
- No libs

### Improvments

- Add more tests units
- Fastlane
- CI

### Important!

For application we are providing the TMDb API key in project for testing and general use, but if you wanted to test with your account you need to create an account at [TMDb](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3)
